partial differential equations

Version
-------
This FISHPACK distribution is identical with the one dated
12/06/2011, except for this present file; thus we have not  
changed the version mumber. It remains at 4.1.

Caveats
-------
FISHPACK 4.1 is written in Fortran 77 but it does not fully comply with the 
Fortran 77 standard. It breaks the standard by calling routines with one type 
of argument and later uses the argument as another type.  There may be other
violations as well. Users whose applications require strict adherence to the 
standard should not use FISHPACK 4.1. 

This distribution is intended for use on Linux and Unix systems.  
The included Makefile is not compatible with Windows makefiles.

Support
-------
NCAR offers no support for this package.

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is provided in HTML format in file FISHPACK4.1.html.  Companion 
file FISH.gif is also required.  Use your browser to open FISHPACK4.1.html and 
navigate its links to view the usage documentation of the user-level routines.

Building the Library
---------------------
The included Makefile is configured to build a static library on several 
available Linux and Unix-like operating systems having a Fortran 77 or 
90 compiler.

Examine file make.inc to see if your OS and compiler are represented.  If they 
are not, you should modify file make.inc and the Makefile in each directory 
(main, src and test) according to your compiler's needs.

The source code is written for single precision real numbers.  If double 
precision is desired, Makefile and make.inc must be modified with the 
appropriate compiler options for promoting real to double precision as 
well as promoting constants to double precision (this is often "-r8" on 
some, but not all, compilers).
